# Python Exercises
## 01 - Program that calculates year of birth!

Cool, we've used strings to make a program that made a welcome message. Now let's use some numerical types.
Create a program that calculates the year of birth.

### Part one:
- Define the variables age and name
- Using age calculate the year in which the user was born
- Print out "OMG [person], you are [age] years old, so you were born in [year]" with the correct values
### Part two:
- Prompt the user to input values for the variables age and name
- Check the user's input to make sure it is correct (age must be a number)
- Figure out a way to account for if the user's birthday has already happened this year or not


## 02 - A Restaurant Waiter Helper program

Now that we've created had some time to use our lists, time to make something more useful.
You are going to make a program that helps a waiter with his menu and his orders.

### Tasks:
Using the following User stories, create a program that fulfills all the requirements:

- As a User I want to be able to see the menu in a formatted way, so that I can order my meal.
- As a User I want to be able to order 3 times, and have my responses added to a list, so they aren't forgotten.
- As a user, I want to have my order read back to me in formatted way, so I know what I ordered.

## 03 - Fizz Buzz!
Super simple game that will substitute multiples of 3 and 5 for fizz and buzz respectively, or fizzbuzz for multiples of both.

### Tasks:
- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
- For multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For the multiples of five print "Buzz" instead of the number.
- For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "FizzBuzz".

## 04 - Scrabble word calculator

Base Scrabble word calculator instructions
Given the below scoring create a Scrabble word calculator that will provide the correct scores dependent on the string provided.

Letter                             Value
A, E, I, O, U, L, N, R, S, T       1
D, G                               2
B, C, M, P                         3
F, H, V, W, Y                      4
K                                  5
J, X                               8
Q, Z                               10

## 05 - Control Flow Age and Permission

### Tasks:
Create a simple program that uses control flow!

Potential outcomes for the program:

You can vote and drive
You can vote
You can drive
You can't legally drink, but your mates/uncles might have your back (bigger 16)
You're too young, go back to school!
User Stories:

As a user I should be able to keep being prompted for input until I say 'exit'

## 06 - Your Hero Story!

### Tasks:
You're going to write a story, cut it into sections and then store the sections in a python dictionary!

- Define a dictionary called story1, it should have the following keys:
'start', 'middle' and 'end'.
- It should use the contents of your story as the values for the keys

- Print the entire dictionary

- Print the type of your dictionary

- Print only the keys

- Print only the values

- Print the individual values using the keys (individually, lots of print commands)

- Now let's add a new key:value pair.
'hero': yourSuperHero

### 07 - Loops and lists
Let's loop over some lists!

### Tasks:
- Make a for loop using range() that prints hello 10 times
- Create another for loop using range that asks the user for names and appends it to a list called list_names
- Make a loop that iterates over each name in list_names and format's so that each name is lowercase, then add these names to a new list called list_names_lower
- Iterate over a list of values and display if they are odd or even

## 08 - Xmas Holiday List that never ends!
Amazing, you've learned about for loops! Time to use that, plus a while loop to keep things going!

### Tasks:
Your task is to create a list of xmas gifts using control flow! Fulfill the user stories to complete the task.

Hint: While loops and break conditions, use lists and append, iterate to print.

User stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to add items to the list, so I can read it later.
- As a user, I want to be able to keep adding things to the list until I use exit.
- As a user, I should be able to use the word exit in a sentence and still have the program terminate, so that anyone can use it.
- As a user, when the program exits, I want to see the complete list in caps lock and numbered, so that I know what to buy. example:
- RC CAR
- PS2
- GTA VICE CITY
